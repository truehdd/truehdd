All notable changes to the truehd library crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `substream_info_changed` field to `DecodedAccessUnit` and `DecoderState` to track substream info changes
- `has_substream_info_changed` field to `ParserState` to track substream info changes

### Changed
- `SubstreamInfoMismatch` and `ExtendedSubstreamInfoMismatch` error level from Error to Warn

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed
- Corrected position coordinates for SpeakerLabels

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-03

### Added
- AccessUnit struct now includes `has_valid_branch` field to indicate valid branch points
- Duplicate sample detection at TrueHD stream branch points. DecodedAccessUnit struct now includes `is_duplicate` field. Such access units should be discarded

### Fixed
- Lossless check failures are now allowed at valid branch points to prevent false positive warnings
- Fix iterator borrowing issue in `ParserState::reset_for_branch()` method

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed seamless branch related struct fields for clarity
  - `ParserState::has_branch` → `peak_data_rate_jump`
  - `ParserState::has_jump` → `has_valid_branch`
  - Updated field usage throughout parser and decoder states for consistent naming
  - Enhanced branch validation logic in restart header processing
- **BREAKING**: `PresentationMap::max_independent_presentation()` now returns `Option<usize>` instead of `usize`
  - Returns `None` when no independent presentations are available
  - Improves error handling for invalid presentation configurations
- Extract jump detection logic into `ParserState::has_jump()` method for better code organization

## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-23

### Fixed
- Seamless branch validation logic in restart header - corrected inverted conditions that caused incorrect validation warnings

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added
- Level-based error handling system with configurable failure thresholds
- `set_fail_level()` methods on `Parser` and `Decoder` structs for configuring error handling behavior
- AU length validation
- Seamless branch validation
- Substream info validation
- Fixed data rate validation

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Corrected `coeff_q` for filter A

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Replaced `fail_on_warning: bool` with `fail_level: log::Level` in `ParserState` and `DecoderState`
- **BREAKING**: `ParserState::default()` now uses `log::Level::Error` instead of `fail_on_warning: false`
- **BREAKING**: `DecoderState::default()` now uses `log::Level::Error` instead of `fail_on_warning: false`
